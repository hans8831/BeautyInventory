Track your beauty  and shop for more

People who are frequenly needed to use beauty products are easy to get lost of what  items they have purchased and when they are expired. As a result, such users may make some unecessary duplicate purchase and then find out they already have some existing ones that are near to expire. 
This app will help users to keep track of their existing beauty products such as open date and expiration date so that they can use the product before they are expired. In addition, it will also let user to shop easily if they find they ready need more
An IOS app called Beauty Keeper has similar functions but the UI interaction are not smooth enough as they have to tap multiple times to go to specific page to manage their products and also have to go back to the main UI and then go to another page to add new items. Finally this app cannot let user to shop item instantly. 

This app has seamless flow for user to add, edit and shop beauty items.
